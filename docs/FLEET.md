# Agent Fleet

Agent Fleet is the local-first control plane for durable multi-worker runs. The
initial CLI surface is:

```sh
codewhale fleet init
codewhale fleet run tasks.json --max-workers 4
codewhale fleet status
codewhale fleet inspect <worker-id>
codewhale fleet logs <worker-id>
codewhale fleet artifacts <worker-id>
codewhale fleet interrupt <worker-id>
codewhale fleet restart <worker-id>
codewhale fleet stop --all
```

Fleet state is stored under the workspace in `.codewhale/fleet.jsonl`. Worker
logs and adapter logs are stored under `.codewhale/fleet/` and
`.codewhale/fleet-host/`.

## Task Spec

`codewhale fleet run` accepts JSON or TOML. A minimal JSON spec:

```json
{
  "name": "local smoke",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "lint",
      "name": "Lint",
      "instructions": "Run the lint check and report failures.",
      "expected_artifacts": ["log"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Workers are optional. If omitted, CodeWhale creates local worker slots up to
`--max-workers`.

Task specs are typed in Rust and keep verification data separate from worker
transcripts. A task can declare:

- `id`, `name`, `description`, `objective`, and `instructions`
- `worker` role, tool profile, tools, and required capabilities
- `workspace` root, required files, writable paths, and environment allowlist
- `input_files`, extra `context`, `budget`, `timeout_seconds`, and `retry_policy`
- `expected_artifacts`, `scorer`, `tags`, and free-form `metadata`

Workers write bounded artifact files under `.codewhale/fleet/` and ledger only
the artifact refs: kind, path, checksum, MIME type, and size. Receipts record
`pass`, `fail`, `partial`, `skip`, or `timeout`; failed receipts may also mark
the source as `transport`, `task`, or `verifier`. `codewhale fleet status`
surfaces those failure-source counts separately.

Deterministic built-in scorers are `exit_code`, `file_exists`, `regex_match`,
and `json_path`. Specs may also declare `command`,
`code_whale_verifier_prompt`, or `manual`; those record a partial receipt until
an explicit verifier pass completes.

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Alerts

Fleet alerting is disabled by default. A caller must supply an enabled alert
config before anything is sent. Routes match typed fleet event classes, not log
strings:

- `stale`
- `restart_exhausted`
- `needs_human`
- `budget_exceeded`
- `verifier_failed`
- `run_completed`

Adapter config stores environment variable names, not secret values. Send-time
code resolves those names from the environment or a future secrets provider.
Ledger records store only audit labels such as `slack`, `webhook`, or
`pagerduty`; task specs persisted in the ledger redact webhook URLs and routing
keys.

Example alert config shape:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "dry_run": true,
  "routes": [
    {
      "events": ["stale", "restart_exhausted", "verifier_failed"],
      "adapter": "ops-slack"
    },
    {
      "events": ["restart_exhausted"],
      "adapter": "pager"
    }
  ],
  "adapters": {
    "ops-slack": {
      "kind": "slack",
      "webhook_env": "CODEWHALE_FLEET_SLACK_WEBHOOK",
      "channel": "#codewhale-fleet"
    },
    "pager": {
      "kind": "pager_duty",
      "routing_key_env": "CODEWHALE_FLEET_PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY",
      "severity": "critical"
    }
  }
}
```

Use dry-run to inspect a redacted adapter payload without sending:

```sh
codewhale fleet alert-dry-run \
  --event stale \
  --run-id fleet-demo \
  --worker-id fleet-demo-local-1 \
  --task-id release-triage \
  --reason "worker heartbeat stale since 2026-06-13T02:00:00Z" \
  --adapter slack
```

The payload includes the run id, worker id, task id, status, short reason, and
safe inspection commands such as `codewhale fleet status` and
`codewhale fleet inspect <worker-id>`. Endpoints, webhook secrets, and
PagerDuty routing keys are shown as `<redacted:env:...>`.

## Status Surfaces

`codewhale fleet status` shows compact counts for queued, running, completed,
partial, failed, restarted, escalated, cancelled, stale, and verifier/transport
failure sources. `inspect` shows the worker state plus the current task
objective, role, host, heartbeat, latest event, artifact refs, latest error, and
alert state. `logs` prints bounded log artifact contents, and `artifacts` lists
artifact refs without embedding large payloads.

The Runtime API exposes the same ledger-backed projection behind the existing
runtime auth middleware:

```text
GET  /v1/fleet/runs
GET  /v1/fleet/runs/{run_id}
GET  /v1/fleet/runs/{run_id}/workers
GET  /v1/fleet/workers/{worker_id}
POST /v1/fleet/workers/{worker_id}/interrupt
POST /v1/fleet/workers/{worker_id}/restart
POST /v1/fleet/runs/{run_id}/stop
```

Action endpoints call the same manager controls as the CLI and record their
decisions in the fleet ledger.

## Host Adapters

The host adapter boundary supports local child processes and explicit SSH
workers. Adapters expose the same operations: start, read status, read bounded
logs, interrupt, restart, stop, and cleanup.

Local workers run as child processes with stdin closed and stdout/stderr written
to bounded fleet host logs. They inherit only a small safe base environment
such as `PATH` and explicitly allowlisted variables.

SSH workers run through the system `ssh` client with `BatchMode=yes` and a
bounded connect timeout. Remote environment variables are sent with OpenSSH
`SendEnv`; values are not embedded in the local ssh argv or fleet logs.

Example SSH worker spec:

```json
{
  "id": "builder-1",
  "name": "Builder 1",
  "host": {
    "kind": "ssh",
    "host": "builder.example.com",
    "user": "codewhale",
    "port": 22,
    "identity": "~/.ssh/codewhale_fleet",
    "working_directory": "/srv/codewhale/work",
    "env_allowlist": ["CODEWHALE_PROFILE"],
    "codewhale_binary": "/usr/local/bin/codewhale"
  },
  "capabilities": ["local", "linux", "tests"],
  "max_concurrent_tasks": 1
}
```

Defaults are intentionally conservative:

- no hosted control plane or cloud provisioning is enabled;
- SSH requires an explicit host, working directory, and CodeWhale binary path;
- secret-like environment names such as `TOKEN`, `SECRET`, `PASSWORD`,
  `API_KEY`, and `PRIVATE_KEY` are rejected from adapter allowlists;
- secrets should remain in CodeWhale config providers or remote host config,
  not in task instructions, argv, or fleet logs.
